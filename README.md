[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Various projects for the self-driving car NanoDegree of Udacity.

The repos contains both C++ and python projects.

The C++ projects are being converted from Microsoft Visual Studio to GNU Make. I use a vagrant Ubuntu box for convenience.
